**Fastest way to get information from the MDN Javascript Reference**

Every Coder now and then runs in a situation not really sure what parameters to pass to a certain function, what are the return values or something like that.

The fastest way i found so far to get exactly the information in need is the site [mdn.io](https://mdn.io).

Lets say you are coding and not sure how to use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` Function correctly.

Most of us probably will start a Google search like `javascript map reduce` and clicking to a few links till we got what we were looking for.

**Good news there is a faster way you will love!**

The fastest way to get directly to the site on the mdn javascript reference is pretty simple:

Just tip in your Browser of choice mdn.io/{parameter}.

**Example:**

[http://mdn.io/mdn.io/map-reduce](http://mdn.io/mdn.io/map-reduce)

which forwards you directly to:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
